Mask-O-Vision is an experimental browser extension for watching movies in thw COVID era. It uses face-tracking technology to detect close-ups of unmasked faces onscreen in order to cover them with computer-generated masks. Mask-O-Vision is the first attempt at a proposed solution for Naked Face Shock, the sensation of being startled by a close-up of an unmasked character in a film or television show because the viewer has internalized the danger of visual proximity to unmasked faces.
