Mask-O-Vision is an experimental browser extension for watching movies in thw COVID era. It uses face-tracking technology to detect close-ups of unmasked faces onscreen in order to cover them with computer-generated masks. Mask-O-Vision is the first attempt at a proposed solution for Naked Face Shock, the sensation of being startled by a close-up of an unmasked character in a film or television show because the viewer has internalized the danger of visual proximity to unmasked faces.

## A note to Mac users:
If this is your first time sharing your screen with either of these browsers, an operating system dialogue will pop up asking you to give the browser permission to do so. Afterwards, you will have to restart the browser and go through these steps again. This is annoying for our purposes, but excellent security practice.
